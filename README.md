# Mediasite-XML-Importer-for-Sony-Vegas

Imports a mediasite Publish-To-Go slideshow into a Sony Vegas video timeline

1. Download the JS file, based on which version of Mediasite you have.
2. Grab a Mediasite presentation by downloading the Publish-To-Go .zip from the web interface. (important)
3. Unzip the Mediasite presentation, put the folder wherever you want.
4. Open a new Vegas project and run the script.
5. A File Browser will pop up; point it at the root folder of your unzipped Mediasite presentation.
6. Done!

## Notes
- If you need a script for a different version of Mediasite, just let me know. It usually only takes a few minutes.
- This was created in 2014, and in 2016 Mediasite added better video download options. Check with them as well!
- This has only been tested with Sony Vegas 12.
